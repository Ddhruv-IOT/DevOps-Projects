## What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is the synergistic approach that unifies software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). Its primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of the software development life cycle, ensuring continuous delivery with uncompromised quality. In essence, DevOps is the key to a seamless transition from code development to deployment.
